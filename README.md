# NYC Citi Bike Analysis & Visualisation with Tableau

## Overview

### Today we analysis data provided to us from the bike-sharing app called Citibike used in NYC to determine if the same bike-sharing program can be used elsewhere. We extracted the data from a CSV file and uses Tableau to breakdown, chart and graph the information into easy to understand images. 

## Results

### We were able to determine that customers and subscribers had taken a total of 2,344,224 rides.


### It was found that a high number of males used the sharing app. 


### The majority of riders regarless of gender preferred short 10 min rides.

### Male riders also had a tendency to rent rides during the weekend and also become subscribers. 




## Summary

### Locaction and understanding your target customers is important for determining the success of a company tryinto to expand to new areas. NYC showed us that location is very impatant, we want to choose areas with more attractions, sceneries and convenience of living. this would allow riders to enjoy a short ride to a new location in the city.
